functions.py: defines all the functions necessary to obtain the angular averaged-power spectrum with error bars. 
1d_power_spectrum: calls the functions in functions.py and also offers the option to simulate random data and obtain its power spectrum.
convergence.py: can make convergence maps
plot_convergence.py: can display the outputs of convergence.py as well as their FT
n_r.py: plots the number and number density of subhalos in 2D and 3D as a function of halocentric distance.
