functions.py: defines all the functions necessary to obtain the angular averaged-power spectrum with error bars. Each function has a little description in the file that explains its inputs/outputs.
1d_power_spectrum: calls the functions in functions.py and also offers the option to simulate random data and obtain its power spectrum.
